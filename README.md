Bulletin Board System

This Bulletin Board System is being developed in Java on a Linux Fedora 24 box. It's primarily as a learning exercise, with some input from the
2600 Hacker Quarterly Group on Facebook. A few ideas for development so far is:

. Games: LORD, Oregan Trail, Usurper, Zork, Trade Wars etc.
. Chat: SysOp to User and User to User chat. IRC integration etc.
. Files: File Storage and Sharing.

Development has not been intensive yet (11/8/2016), but plans are to complete a working system before years end.
