Bulletin Board System

I am writing this to explain this project. BBS or Bulletin Board System Software should be self explanitory. I am developing this Software
in Java on Linux Fedora 24. Why? For shits and giggles. If I sit at home, without brushing up on my skills, then I accomplish nothing. So
this is an exercise on creating a BBS, then releasing it into the wild for testing and feedback.

Releasing it into the wild for testing? Bat shit nuts I know, but this will be a short term venture, but only on a VM of my choosing. If 
you're interested in keeping up to date with my progress, then let me know.
